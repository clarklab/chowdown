ingredients:
  - 2 oranges

  - 1/2 cup water

directions:
  - Peel the oranges and remove the inside layer of pith
  - Julienne slice the peel and put in a pan with enough cold water to cover
  - Bring to the edge of boiling and drain
  - Repeat this blanching process a total of three times. This removes the bitterness.
