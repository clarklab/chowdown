image: collards-with-black-eyed-peas.jpeg
tags: vegetarian, legumes

ingredients:
- 2.5 cups cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth
- 2 chipotles in adobo sauce
- 1 small Spanish onion, halved
- salt (for seasoning)
- pepper (for seasoning)
- 2.5 lbs collard greens, ribs discarded and leaves chopped
- One 15-oz. can black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed
- 2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar

directions:
- In a large saucepan or stockpot, combine 1.5 cups of the stock with the chipotles,
  onion and a generous pinch each of salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Add the
  collards in large handfuls, letting each batch wilt slightly before adding more.
- Cover and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the collards are
  just tender, about 25 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring occasionaly, until the
  broth is slightly reduced, about 7 minutes; discard the chipotles and the onion.
- Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the black-eyed peas with the remaining 1
  cup of stock and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderate heat for 8 minutes; season
  with salt and pepper. Using a slotted spoon, add the black-eyed peas to the collards;
  reserve the bean broth for another use. Add the vinegar to the collard greens and
  season with salt and pepper.

This recipe appears to be from a Food and Wine feature called ["Bobby Flay's
Kentucky"](https://www.foodandwine.com/chefs/bobby-flays-kentucky-thoroughbred-horses-and-buttermilk-biscuits). According
to *Food & Wine*:

> This marriage of two Southern Classics&mdash;slow-cooked collards and tender
> black-eyed peas&mdash;is smart and delicious. Flay uses canned chipotles in adobo
> to give this dish a smoky flavor.

Also, you can make part of the recipe ahead of time:

> The cooked collard greens and black-eyed peas in their broth can be refrigerated
> separately for up to 2 days. Reheat both dishes gently before continuing with the
> recipe.

From Ben: 

> I don't remember exactly when my mom made this recipe, but I recall her talking
> fondly about Southern food from her time going to college (and then working) in
> Nashville.
